As usual, I'll check email and WhatsApp while traveling, but it will be hard for me to schedule any meetings that week. I'll be back in LA the following week with a much more flexible schedule. While in Bolivia, I will be working with the La Fundación para el Periodismo, which is headed by Renen Estessoro. (FYI - the initial connection came from our mutual friend, and I believe former ICFJ Fellow, Hena Cuevas). Renen originally asked me to do a series of workshops on investigative journalism - I recommended that he hire Fabiola for that instead and she and David Hidalgo split the 5 seminars between them and presented them in April. I am going now to do a follow up seminar on Entrepreneurial Journalism to help Renen develop an online media site at the Foundation, as well as to support the efforts of a selected group of participants from Fabiola and David's workshops. By wonderful coincidence, Carlos Huertes of Connectas will also be in Santa Cruz at the same time, so in addition to the 2-day workshop I will be running on Entrepreneurial journalism, I will also be sharing the stage with Carlos for an event at the Universidad NUR de Santa Cruz - he and I will each give 1.5 hour presentations that evening for students, faculty, and the public.",

Also, Govt of India's initiative of forming a task force with a mandate to prepare a long term roadmap for the next three Olympics and a short term strategy for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics does not have a single woman in its team. She uses her experience and the amount of funds spent on the scheme and correlates with experiences on the field, which clearly show that the program is not benefiting the target group. Her observations as a former volleyball player are interesting in the wake of the fantastic show of women in the Olympics, where the women won despite the system and not because of it.",

The first Live video was for their morning show with one of Pakistan’s most famous cricketers. It was a post-show Facebook Live session where the show’s hosts had a short Q & A with the guest based on questions asked on social media. It did really well overall. After that they branched out into headlines for their 6pm and 9ppm bulletins and some breaking news. This has been important for Geo News because they are a broadcast channel and with the help of Facebook Live they will now be able to tap into a wider digital audience as well, focusing on original content for digital and content that is already being transmitted on television.",

Once things kicked off internally Geo’s Live strategy was expanded to included:\n\nPorting their television feed straight to Facebook Live for headlines and breaking news situations\nPorting clean feeds to Live from their satellite vans in the field\nShows created exclusively for Facebook Live using their current studio setup\n\nNo additional costs were incurred for their Live strategy implementation and all in-house resources were used.\n\nThey currently have one of the largest and most active Facebook Live setups, with reporters regularly broadcasting, exclusive shows and TV feeds.\n\nOut of the 50 videos in the year since Geo started Facebook Live, 21 have been been Facebook Live and the rest news packages and digital videos. Geo has crossed the million mark twice with Facebook live:\n\nNews headlines from the studio (1.9 million views)\nTelevision broadcast to Facebook Live (over 1 million views)\n\nContent that has worked out for Geo News really well:\n\nBreaking news\nHourly headlines\nSports\nFood\nHealth",

Also, it is very topical in this region considering the violence Rohingyas face in Myanmar. The noteworthy part was even the print section of Indian Express took up the story. Also, stories initiated by web teams are rarely taken up by the print teams (in the newspaper). All on ground reports are usually print exclusives. Mostly because the web team rarely ventures out to report due to the overwhelming work load. What was different for this story (of the #GENDERAND series) was that the web team planned the story, edited the story, shaped the story in collaboration with the reporter and then timed it in a way that it can go both in print and web on the same day. The web exclusive ground report was planned for the first time by the web team and that then made its way into the paper. The web story is longer, 1200 words while the print version was only 500 words.\nThis story was boosted (paid promotion) on Facebook. \n\nEducation stories are not just about campus reporting. Education stories also involve an intersection of larger social in",

His site is considered especially necessary because it’s in the poorest area of the country where historically there have been little or no sources of local news. Thanks to Janine's seminar and webinar he has a growing understanding of how and why he needs to develop a business model and not just run his news site as a volunteer if he wants to have long-term impact. Among his new ideas for revenue, he is starting is a local business directory, where he can provide very low-cost ads to a wide range of local businesses",

      "description": "This is the 15th story in the #GenderAND series. This story is important because the Dalit community has historically been repressed socially, economically, culturally and in all other possible aspects by the so-called upper caste groups in India. It's a community that is outside the caste structure and are also considered \"untouchables\" by the same so-called upper caste communities. This is a terrible thing also because caste is a major determining factor of Indian society just like class is in many other parts of the world.  In addition, violence against the Dalit community has increased in many parts of India, especially in places where Bhartiya Janata party (India's current ruling party and Hindu nationalist party) has been in power. Dalit women are vulnerable on several counts- their caste, class and gender. This piece explores what is means to be a Dalit women in contemporary India. One can say that it is similar to an exploration of what it means to be a Black woman in contemporary USA.",

Jamina Travieso, wrote to explain how important the MOOC was in helping her understand how to launch a magazine called Antithesis. \n\nThis new site was created by journalists who took the MOOC by Janine, James, and Mij; and a seminar at MediaParty by Mij, Fabiola and Patricia; quí su web: http://revistantitesis.com/, add notes about the site itself, which is focused on culture with multimedia narratives\n\nHace un tiempo, le contamos a ICFJ la historia de una alumna del MOOC. Ayer, finalmente lanzaron su medio, inspirado en el workshop que dimos con Patricia y Fabi y nuestro MOOC.\n\nAquí su web: http://revistantitesis.com/\n\nQuería compartírtelo para que puedas incluirlo en tus reportes.\n\nFrom Mij via email: The main reason why Antítesis is a relevant example is because there is a very few independent media outlets in Mendoza, the Argentinian frontier province with Chile. Their team will be conformed by Argentinian and Chilean journalists, a really good message for the endless rivality between both countries. \n\nJimena Travieso's project will be focused in investigative reporting. \"We investigate where only a few people do, we see where others don't see and we create text that leave a mark.\" Travieso's background is also interesting, she is an attorney with a master in journalism with experience in freedom of speech issues. \n\nAnother interesting thing about Antítesis is that they will publish investigative reports among other \"positive\" content. Here's how Jimena explains it: \"Antítesis are the opposites that make up our worldview: we investigate the consequences of corrupt acts, government inaction or bad state policies, but we also tell stories of people who, in the face of adversity, come out ahead, help, inspire and Are committed to changing their environment.\"",

Not enough collaboration b/w them and traditional storytelling teams like the politics bureau, etc. This olympics stuff for ex, note the byline. Just Labs staff. None of their main sports correspondents.\n\nAll of this spearheaded by Labs lead Anand Katakam. Then there’s mojo video stuff led by Yusuf Omar. Our accomplishment is that we built the case and capacity for the org to hire such folks. If DFs had continued, these specialists would also have a forum to collaborate with good storytellers from across the newsroom. Right now, just limited to the few folks they’ve befriended.\"",

As usual, I'll check email and WhatsApp while traveling, but it will be hard for me to schedule any meetings that week. I'll be back in LA the following week with a much more flexible schedule. While in Bolivia, I will be working with the La Fundación para el Periodismo, which is headed by Renen Estessoro. (FYI - the initial connection came from our mutual friend, and I believe former ICFJ Fellow, Hena Cuevas). Renen originally asked me to do a series of workshops on investigative journalism - I recommended that he hire Fabiola for that instead and she and David Hidalgo split the 5 seminars between them and presented them in April. I am going now to do a follow up seminar on Entrepreneurial Journalism to help Renen develop an online media site at the Foundation, as well as to support the efforts of a selected group of participants from Fabiola and David's workshops. By wonderful coincidence, Carlos Huertes of Connectas will also be in Santa Cruz at the same time, so in addition to the 2-day workshop I will be running on Entrepreneurial journalism, I will also be sharing the stage with Carlos for an event at the Universidad NUR de Santa Cruz - he and I will each give 1.5 hour presentations that evening for students, faculty, and the public.",

He send me this via Facebook:\n\nHola Janine. Le había comentado en diciembre (después del curso) que por ahí estaba desarrollando un proyecto. Se trata de este blog www.libroshistorias.com que ya lancé desde el 1o de mayo. Esta es la primera etapa. Por ahora lo estoy promocionando para ganar tráfico. El mercado es reducido, si consideramos que solo 2 de cada 10 personas leen un libro en últimos meses en Costa Rica. Pero igualmente es un nicho muy descuidado, con pocas publicaciones en medios y apenas hay un blog especializado de crítica, casi que solo para conocedores: filólogos, escritores, profesionales de literatura. En mi caso combinó reseñas e información de literatura clásica con contemporánea y best seller, así como relatos. Más adelante vendrán crónicas breves (\"el móvil manda\") y en una tercera etapa multimedia y más cosas. Conforme gane tráfico viene el tema de monetización. Como complemento: redes sociales con mi cuenta en Twitter, Instagram y Google+, y por supuesto Facebook donde espero alcanzar -antes de pagar publicidad- entre 200 y 300 seguidores. Es esta https://m.facebook.com/cacorderop/. Más adelante (en otro poco de tiempo) le contaré avances y aprendizajes. Juan Pablo Ferrari me conoce por cualquier cosa. Solo quería contarle porque del curso hay resultados que, aunque sencillos, es bueno saber, creo. Saludos y gracias por su atención.",
